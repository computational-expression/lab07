# Lab 7 Reflection

## Function Organization

Describe how you organized your code using functions (use a markdown list for this answer):

- **Sensor reading function:** TODO: Describe how your function handles DHT22 sensor communication and error checking
- **Temperature conversion function:** TODO: Describe how your function performs temperature unit conversion
- **Comfort assessment function:** TODO: Describe how your function evaluates environmental comfort using temperature and humidity
- **Condition classification function:** TODO: Describe how your function categorizes temperature and humidity levels
- **Reading display function:** TODO: Describe how your function formats and shows individual sensor readings
- **Statistics calculation function:** TODO: Describe how your function processes multiple readings for analysis
- **Summary display function:** TODO: Describe how your function presents statistical results
- **User interaction function:** TODO: Describe how your function manages user interaction between readings
- **main() function:** TODO: Describe how this function coordinates the overall monitoring system

## Program Flow

Describe the order of function calls in your environment monitoring system (use a numbered markdown list for this answer):

TODO: List the sequence of function calls from start to finish

## Creative Choices

TODO: Describe any creative choices you made in your environment monitoring implementation (don't use markdown list for this answer)

## Challenges

TODO: Describe the main challenges you faced during this lab (don't use markdown list for this answer)

## Learning

TODO: What are the most important things you learned about functions and sensor programming during this lab? (don't use markdown list for this answer)

## Improvements

If you were to complete this assignment again, what would you do differently to (use a markdown list for this answer):

- TODO: Improve your function design and sensor data handling
- TODO: Create better user interaction and data presentation
- TODO: Enhance the environmental analysis and statistical calculations
